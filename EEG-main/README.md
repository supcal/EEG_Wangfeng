# Attention-based Temporal Graph Representation Network (ATGRNet) for EEG-based Emotion Recognition

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of the Attention-based Temporal Graph Representation Network (ATGRNet), as proposed in our paper "Attention-based Temporal Graph Representation Learning for EEG-based Emotion Recognition". ATGRNet integrates various neural network techniques including hierarchical attention mechanisms, graph convolutional networks, and temporal convolutional networks to address challenges in EEG-based emotion recognition.

## Abstract
Due to the objectivity of emotional expression in the central nervous system, EEG-based emotion recognition can effectively reflect humans' internal emotional states. Our model leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism, graph convolution with top-k operations, a residual-based graph readout mechanism, and temporal convolution to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the SEED, DEAP, and FACED datasets.

## Datasets
Our model is evaluated on the following datasets:
- SEED
- DEAP
- FACED
Ensure to follow the dataset providers' guidelines and terms of use.
